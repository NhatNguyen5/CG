# Instruction
Compile with <b>Visual Studio 2019</b> using command lines
Compile: <b>g++ -o hw1.exe hw1.cpp</b>  
Execute: <b>.\hw1.exe 400</b> <sub>(400 so the image size is larger than the circle size, any smaller size image will result in error)</sub>  
<sub><sup>Because the assignment did not say that the radius of the cicle will be adjustable,  
I just make it so it will generate 2 half circle with r = 100 and r = 150 </sup></sub>
