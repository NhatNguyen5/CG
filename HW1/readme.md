# Instruction
Compile with <b>Visual Studio 2019</b> using command lines  
Compile: <b>g++ -o hw1.exe hw1.cpp</b>  
Execute: <b>.\hw1.exe 400</b>  
<sub>(In fact, any number > 200 will work, image size <= 300 will result in error)</sub>  
<sub><sup>Because the assignment did not say that the radius of the cicle needs to be adjustable,  
I just make it so it will generate 2 half circle with r = 100 and r = 150 </sup></sub>
